PCB - Notes
===================
In the PCB design in this folder, there are a few minor mistakes
1. R8 (10K) is missing
2. C10 (220u) is missing
3. RA4 is used instead of RC1. (workaround: short RA4 and RC1)



Initially, the circuit is designed for drawing 80mA current at each branch (or segment) of the LED display, which has a ~ 6.2 Volt drop in each segment. Hence the total current at common is ~640mA, and BD140 is selected. But later, it is found that a 350mA is sufficient for enough brightness and changed to BC328, and they are available in a smaller package (TO92).

Displays are common anode type 2.1 inch red.

IR Receiver and IR LED are included for future modifications. The circuit is functioning well without the resistors marked as unused (R34, R36, R39, R42, R46, R48 etc.).

The PCB is not designed by myself therefore unable to correct the PCB design according to the corrected (later) schematic.
